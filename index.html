        The data featured on the maps below was created from a paper mapping activity
         at our pop-ups on the 21st of March; one in the afternoon at <b>Catigal
         Green</b> and the other in the evening outside of <b>Newtown Station</b>.
        <br><br>
        We asked people to place a sticker on a paper map to mark areas they feel
         <span id="safe-text">safe</span> or <span id="unsafe-text">unsafe</span> at night. We 
         had <b>96</b> responses, here they are, mapped.

        Now, taking this data and creating a <b>heatmap</b> results in the following map.
        <span id="layer-selectors">
            <button id='safe-heatmap-toggle' class="layer-button active">Safe Areas</button>
            <button id='unsafe-heatmap-toggle' class="layer-button active">Unsafe Areas</button>
        </span>
    </div>

    <div id='heat-map' class="map"></div>
